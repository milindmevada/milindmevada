## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m â€‹Milindâ€‹ - â€‹a Flutter & Google Certified Associate Android Developer who has a hunger for learning and a zeal for excellence. Iâ€™m a self-learner and love to push my own boundaries.

Iâ€™m currently working on Flutter for Mobile app development and have been learning Flutter since the day Google announced it was moving Flutter out of Beta. I have a â€‹total work experience of ~4â€‹ years and have worked on projects in different domains.

I love writing blogs and sharing knowledge.
